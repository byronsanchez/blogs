	  "value": "This site was mainly created for the purposes of cataloging anything useful I learn. When I was younger, I honestly thought development would be an impossible skill to learn. There ended up being \"key lessons\" that I ultimately figured out. I will never forget them. But honestly, it wouldn't have hurt to learn them sooner. Maybe this blog will help others in figuring things out!"

	  "type": "p",
	  "value": "The portions of the site that make use of dynamic content generation use JavaScript to PHP as the client to server languages.
