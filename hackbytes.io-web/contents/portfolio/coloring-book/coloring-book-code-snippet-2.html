<!-- CODE SNIPPET -->

<h2>Code Snippet</h2>

<p class="snippet-description">
	Because the device can be a phone, a tablet, or anything in between,
	this code first examines the picture to be loaded before performing any
	memory allocations. Scaling is performed only if the picture is bigger
	than the screen of the device in use. No scale-ups are performed to
	prevent degradation of picture quality. Memory allocation occurs only
	AFTER screen-metric analysis to ensure heap memory is preserved.
</p>

<div class="code-sample">

```java
private Bitmap decodeImage(int resId) {

    // Get the screen width and height.
    DisplayMetrics dm = new DisplayMetrics();
    getWindowManager().getDefaultDisplay().getMetrics(dm);
    float screenWidth = dm.widthPixels;
    float screenHeight = dm.heightPixels;

    // Decode the resource's bound information.
    BitmapFactory.Options options = new BitmapFactory.Options();
    options.inJustDecodeBounds = true;
    BitmapFactory.decodeResource(getResources(),
            resId, options);

    int inSampleSize = 1;
    int imageWidth = options.outWidth;
    int imageHeight = options.outHeight;

    // If the scale fails, we will need to use more memory to perform
    // scaling for the layout, to support all screen sizes.
    boolean scaleFailed = false;
    Bitmap scaledBitmap = null;
    float resizeRatioHeight = 1;

    // Scale down if the image width exceeds the screen width.
    if (imageWidth > screenWidth || imageHeight > screenHeight) {

        // If we need to resize the image because the width or height is too
        // big, get the resize ratios relative to landscape orientation.
        resizeRatioHeight = (float) imageHeight / (float) screenHeight;

        inSampleSize = (int) resizeRatioHeight;

        if (inSampleSize <= 1) {
            scaleFailed = true;
        }
    }

    // Decode Bitmap with the proper scaling factor.
    options.inSampleSize = inSampleSize;
    options.inJustDecodeBounds = false;

    Bitmap picture = BitmapFactory.decodeResource(getResources(), resId, options);

    // If the scale failed, that means a scale was needed but didn't occur.
    // We need to create a scaled copy of the image by allocating more
    // memory. This is a last-resort scaling operation.
    if (scaleFailed) {
        int newWidth = (int) (picture.getWidth() / resizeRatioHeight);
        int newHeight = (int) (picture.getHeight() / resizeRatioHeight);

        scaledBitmap = Bitmap.createScaledBitmap(picture, newWidth, newHeight, true);

        // Release the original unscaled bitmap from memory.
        picture.recycle();
    }
    else {
        // No last-resort scaling was needed!
        scaledBitmap = picture;
    }

    // Return the decoded picture to prepare for on-screen display.
    return scaledBitmap;
}
