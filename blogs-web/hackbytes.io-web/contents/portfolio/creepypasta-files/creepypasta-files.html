<h3>Project Details</h3>

<p>
	This application currently contains over 100 stories. New
	stories are constantly reviewed and approved for entry into
	the Creepypasta Files database.
</p>

<h3>Over 100 stories to read.</h3>

<p>
	There are hundreds of creepypasta available all over the web.
	We've compiled some of the most popular stories and packaged
	them in a free application for your mobile device or tablet.
</p>

<h4>Keep track with bookmarks</h4>

<p>
	It can be difficult to navigate through hundreds of stories.
	Bookmarks give you a way to save references to your favorite
	stories, or to a story you want to continue reading some other
	time.
</p>

<p>
	You can add or remove bookmarks whenever you are reading a
	story by pressing the bookmark button on the top-right corner
	of the screen.
</p>

<h4>Portrait and Landscape support</h4>

<p>
	This application supports all device orientations. Through the
	use of autoresizing masks, UI elements remain proportional and
	the user-experience is not compromised.
</p>

<h3>On-the-fly settings.</h3>

<p>
	Access the settings screen whenever you want. Just press the
	settings button on the top right corner. Other settings are
	automatically configured and tailored for the device in use.
</p>

<h4>Text-size</h4>

<p>
	If, for whatever reason, you want to change the text size, you
	can do so in the settings screen. Simply click the text size
	button, and select a size.
</p>

<h4>Images</h4>

<p>
	Whenever possible and relevant, an image may be displayed
	along with the story. There aren't many, but these images
	provide a much stronger vibe and realism to each story.
</p>

<h4>Phone and Tablet support</h4>

<p>
	Whether you are using a mobile device or a tablet, this
	application has got you covered. Text and images will be
	rendered in appropriate sizes for each device. Tablet screens
	allow for slightly bigger text and larger images. Phones will
	render images to fit on the screen, relative to the
	screen-width.
