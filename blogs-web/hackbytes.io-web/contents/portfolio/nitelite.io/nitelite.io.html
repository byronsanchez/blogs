<h2>Project Details</h2>

<p>
	niteLite.io is the blog I run for music and other creative projects. The main reason for this
	blog's existence is to explore ideas related to production, composition, music psychology, and anything else
	I might find interesting in the domain of music.
</p>

<h2>Built with powerful systems.</h2>

<p>
	This entire website is built on top of and makes use of some of
	the most powerful systems available in web application
	development.
</p>

<h3>Statically-generated</h3>

<p>
	Almost every part of the site is statically generated. This
	means that most of what a user sees are previously generated
	html files (thanks to <a
		href="https://github.com/jnordberg/wintersmith"><b>Wintersmith</b></a>).
	This is a perfect system for a simple blog, where dynamic
	programs typically cause much more overhead than it's worth.
</p>

<p>
	The portions of the site that make use of dynamic content
	generation use CoffeeScript (to JavaScript) to PHP as the
	client to server languages. Once the server has generated
	tailored content, it passes the generated data back to the
	JavaScript file as a JSON object. From there, the data is
	presented to the user.
</p>

<h3>Powered by Foundation</h3>

<p>
	The website is built on top of Zurb's Foundation Framework.
	The website is mobile-ready and works on a wide range of
	devices.
