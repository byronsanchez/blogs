<!-- CODE SNIPPET -->
<h2>Code Snippet</h2>

<p class="snippet-description">
	The following code analyzes all touch events and constrains them to the
	portion of the screen containing the coloring page. If a user is
	coloring and if the drag event goes out of bounds, the most recent
	in-bound coordinates are used to render more coloring points. The result
	is that coloring out of bounds will simply color the edges of the page
	as opposed to having the application simply stop painting at the edges
	altogether. This way, the application remains responsive to all user
	input, while maintaining a consistent experience.
</p>

<div class="code-sample">

```objectivec
- (void)touchEventX:(CGFloat *)x y:(CGFloat *)y {

  // NOTE: Color strokes are referred to as drawings.

  // If the user exceeds any bound.
  if (*x < 0) {
    // Check if a draw has previously occured within bounds.
    if (_lastX == -1) {
      // If not, then use the default bound limit.
      *x = 0;
    } else {
      // Else, use the last acceptable inbound position.
      *x = _lastX;
    }
  }
  // Do the same for the upper bound limit.
  else if (*x > _imageWidth) {
    if (_lastX == -1) {
      *x = _imageWidth;
    } else {
      *x = _lastX;
    }
  }
  // If a user is in bound...
  else {
    // Locally cache the bound for future out-of-bound handling.
    _lastX = *x;
  }

  // Rinse and repeat for y.
  if (*y < 0) {
    if (_lastY == -1) {
      *y = 0;
    } else {
      *y = _lastY;
    }
  }
  else if (*y > _imageHeight) {
    if (_lastY == -1) {
      *y = _imageHeight;
    } else {
      *y = _lastY;
    }
  }
  else {
    _lastY = *y;
  }

}
