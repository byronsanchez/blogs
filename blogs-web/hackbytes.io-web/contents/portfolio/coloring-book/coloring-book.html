<h3>Project Details</h3>

<p>
	Coloring Book is for anyone of any age and contains lots of pictures to color!
	This application contains no ads.
</p>

<h3>Multiple books to choose from</h3>

<p>
	Coloring Book contains many different collections of images to
	color.
</p>

<h4>Coloring Books</h4>

<p>
	Each coloring book, represented by a single canvas, contains a
	set of 10 images. The application comes with a free set to
	color. Should you decide you want more, you can always
	purchase more sets in the application shop.
</p>

<p>
	Each set is a purchase-once unlimited use item. All purchases
	are restorable. So even if, one day, you uninstall the
	application and decide to reinstall it in the future, you will
	be able to color your purchased sets.
</p>

<p>
	The pictures range from toys and games to farm animals and
	cute pets. And more are on their way. As more sets get
	released, there will be more and more images to color.
</p>

<h3>Paint or Fill? Brush or bucket?</h3>

<p>
	With these tools at your disposal, you can color your images
	exactly how you want to.
</p>

<h4>Brush-mode</h4>

<p>
	With brush-mode, gone are the days where you just touch an
	area to fill it with color. Brush-mode allows you to color an
	image exactly the way you want to.
</p>

<p>
	The brush-mode algoritms are constantly being improved in each
	update to allow for ever-improving accuracy on mobile devices.
</p>

<h4>Fill-mode</h4>

<p>
	Fill-mode allows you to completely fill a bounded section with
	color. The floodfill algorithm allows for pixel-perfect
	accuracy when using the fill-bucket.
</p>

<h3>It's all in the layers...</h3>

<p>
	The coloring book rendering engine uses multiple layers for
	rendering the image. This has many benefits and gives more
	control with regards to the presentation of the coloring
	pages.
</p>

<h4>Erase with ease</h4>

<p>
	Erasing your colors will not erase the picture. The colors a
	user paints and the actual picture are drawn to two seperate
	layers. The result is that the picture will always be
	displayed, no matter how a user chooses to alter the image.
</p>

<h4>Layer maps make flood-filling a breeze</h4>

<p>
	Each picture is backed by a "layer map." These maps contain an
	outline of the pictures, with the outline being 1 pixel in
	width. The on-screen picture's stroke-widths vary, as can be
	seen on the images to the left. The maps let the flood-fill
	algorithm fill an area without producing aliasing artifacts.
	The layering also allows for the fill to occur
	"behind-the-scenes." The user only sees the result of the
	algorithm.
</p>
