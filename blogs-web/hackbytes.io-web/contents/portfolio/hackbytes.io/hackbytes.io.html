<h2>Project Details</h2>

<p>
	hackBytes.io is the site I run for software, productivity, and other engineering and technical projects. I sometimes
	like to write about anything related to the bleeding edge of product development and productivity, so hackBytes.io
	is my channel for these writings.
</p>

<p>
	hackBytes.io replaces my old <a href="/hackbytes.com/">hackbytes.com</a> blog.
</p>

<h2>Built with powerful systems.</h2>

<p>
	This entire website is built on top of and makes use of some of
	the most powerful systems available in web application
	development.
</p>

<h3>Statically-generated</h3>

<p>
	Almost every part of the site is statically generated. This
	means that most of what a user sees are previously generated
	html files (thanks to <a
		href="https://github.com/jnordberg/wintersmith"><b>Wintersmith</b></a>).
	This is a perfect system for a simple blog, where dynamic
	programs typically cause much more overhead than it's worth.
</p>

<p>
	The portions of the site that make use of dynamic content
	generation use CoffeeScript (to JavaScript) to PHP as the
	client to server languages. Once the server has generated
	tailored content, it passes the generated data back to the
	JavaScript file as a JSON object. From there, the data is
	presented to the user.
</p>

<h3>Powered by Foundation</h3>

<p>
	The website is built on top of Zurb's Foundation Framework.
	The website is mobile-ready and works on a wide range of
	devices.
</p>
