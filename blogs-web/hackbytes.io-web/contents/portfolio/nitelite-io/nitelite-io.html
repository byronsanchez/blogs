<h2>Project Details</h2>

<p>
	niteLite.io is my personal blog. The main reason for this
	blog's existence is to hold myself accountable for the
	projects I take on. This is, in essence, my own personal
	journal for tracking progress on my different projects. A list
	of all my projects are available in my <a
		href="http://nitelite.io/projects">curriculum vitae</a>.
</p>

<h2>Designed for Skill Development</h2>

<h3>Simple navigation</h3>

<p>
	The hierarchy of the site's pages is kept relatively simple.
	Every skill has a journal as well as a notebook. When the
	final website is generated, the multi-notebook hierarchy is
	flattened to keep navigation simple. From there, skills are
	tracked by tags which the user can use to filter posts.
</p>

<h3>Goals</h3>

<p>
	On the path to completing my projects, I attempt to complete
	many different goals. When it comes to goals, I want to make
	sure that I try to achieve them. I want to make sure that I
	make the attempt, instead of forgetting about them and
	allowing time to slip by without even trying! You can see my
	current goals on the <a href="http://nitelite.io/goals">goals
	page</a>.
</p>

<h3>Habits</h3>

<p>
	The <a href="http://nitelite.io/habits">habits page</a> contains a list of
	habits that I have committed to doing on a regular basis. I believe consistency
	is important because it builds mental strength and reduces the chances of you
	giving into procrastination, laziness, and any other excuse the mind may be
	tempted to use in order to rationalize not doing something difficult. If I can't
	be consistent with these simple habits, then how the hell will I have the mental
	strength to fight against any other future mental resistance when tougher
	challenges come my way? Habits, in my opinion, are important to keep to.
</p>

<h3>The Vision</h3>

<p>
	I don't care whether or not I succeed in anything I do. It'd
	definitely be awesome to accomplish all my goals and it
	definitely sucks when you put effort in something and get
	nothing in return. But the worst feeling, for me, is knowing
	that I wanted something, knowing that I could have put in the
	effort, but *chose* not to do so. This blog is dedicated to
	ensuring I choose action every single time.
</p>

<h2>Built with powerful systems.</h2>

<p>
	This entire website is built on top of and makes use of some of
	the most powerful systems available in web application
	development.
</p>

<h3>Statically-generated</h3>

<p>
	Almost every part of the site is statically generated. This
	means that most of what a user sees are previously generated
	html files (thanks to <a
		href="https://github.com/jnordberg/wintersmith"><b>Wintersmith</b></a>).
	This is a perfect system for a simple blog, where dynamic
	programs typically cause much more overhead than it's worth.
</p>

<p>
	The portions of the site that make use of dynamic content
	generation use CoffeeScript (to JavaScript) to PHP as the
	client to server languages. Once the server has generated
	tailored content, it passes the generated data back to the
	JavaScript file as a JSON object. From there, the data is
	presented to the user.
</p>

<h3>Powered by Foundation</h3>

<p>
	The website is built on top of Zurb's Foundation Framework.
	The website is mobile-ready and works on a wide range of
	devices.
