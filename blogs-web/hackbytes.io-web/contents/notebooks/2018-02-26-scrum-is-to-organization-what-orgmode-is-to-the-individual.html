<a href="/x:/notebook/org/capture.html#MissingReference">It may be that forecasting and probability in sales is <i>just like</i> in software</a>
</p>

<p>
This is tricky to navigate.
</p>

<p>
Org-mode is awesome for the individual because it clearly lays out all potential
paths you could walk and has you start managing them via externalized memory and
regular check ins.
</p>

<p>
A well implemented project management cycle is the same in any organization.
Scrum tries to package itself as the project management solution to do this.
</p>

<p>
As a result, some organizations are wildly successful with scrum, while others
are 100% mediocre.
</p>

<p>
Project management may be a fractal pattern, from the individual, to the
organization, and beyond.
</p>

<p>
Which means at an ideal level, perhaps, the individual is doing something like
org-mode + GTD, the organization is doing something like project documentation +
scrum, The business is doing it's analogue as a whole (the CEO + board of
directors).
</p>

<p>
But it has to <i>align</i>. The individual GTD can't be compromised for the
organization. But the organization can't be compromised for the individual. It
has to be harmony or it fails.
</p>

<p>
AKA scrum has to expect the individual to follow affinity paths (even to the
point where the user's assigned stories don't get done <i>period</i>), but leverage
estimates + reality feedback to be able to make future projections that are at
least semi-realistic so that business decisions get made, as long as all parties
understand the volatility inherent in any strategy (because we <i>don't</i> know what
the reality is of the market place, competitors, etc.; so the volatility in our
product development and business strategies can sometimes serve as the chaotic
counterpart to reality's chaos).
</p>

<p>
Of course, it's reasonable for the organization to know what was done instead of
the stories and if the developer were following affinity paths, ideally it'd
result in exponential returns.
</p>

<p>
And so on and so forth.
</p>

<p>
Forecasting plays a role in giving semi-realistic basis for making decisions in
other parts of the organization, so long as it's not more time-consuming than it
needs to be and so long as all parties understand the volatility inherent in the
forecast.
</p>

<p>
Scrum isn't bad, but it seems to propagate mediocre dynamics just like the
cubicle did.
</p>

<p>
A good organization with quality project management is good <i>in spite of</i> scrum.
Because they'd be good anyway without it (eg. the product leader knows GTD even
if he doesn't know <i>of</i> GTD and knows how to interface with the higher and lower
levels of the org in terms of forecasting). And they'd pick and choose the
<i>useful</i> components of scrum relative to their needs.
</p>

<p>
Turns out I don't hate scrum and project management.
</p>

<p>
I just hate when it's done in an unharmonious fashion.
</p>

<p>
When it kills the individual or stalls the organization. The individual one is
worse in the short-term because it means the individual worker's day-to-day life
sucks and is closer to a prison. The organizational one is worse in the
long-term (and more catastrophic because of the network effect in the
meta-organization and the individuals it affects) because it means the
organization will probably die. It ain't effectively getting ahead of the 2
snakes.</p>
