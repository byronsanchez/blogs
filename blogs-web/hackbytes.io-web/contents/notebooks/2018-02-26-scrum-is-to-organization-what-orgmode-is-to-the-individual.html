<a href="/x:/notebook/org/capture.html#MissingReference">It may be that forecasting and probability in sales is <i>just like</i> in software</a>
</p>

<p>
This is a tricky one to navigate and think through. I'll try my best to
articulate my thoughts on Scrum, how it relates to GTD, and some new epiphanies
I had about the roles they play in successfully creating software.
</p>

<p>
Org-mode and GTD are awesome tools for the individual because they clearly lay
out all potential paths you could walk and has you start managing them via
externalized memory and regular check ins. In other words, these tools have you
write down and outline all possible tasks and projects you <i>may</i> want to pursue.
And in doing so, you directly face your list of all possible paths you can take,
all possible action steps you can execute on.
</p>

<p>
And then you perpetually manage this system in regular intervals, always moving
forward with your projects in some way.
</p>

<p>
A well implemented project management cycle is the same in any organization.
Scrum tries to package itself as the project management solution to do this.
Scrum attempts to be the organizational-level version of GTD. It attempts to
externalize memory from the individuals on the team via wikis, issue trackers,
and kanban boards. Sprint meetings and retrospectives are the Scrum analogues to
GTD's weekly reviews.
</p>

<p>
Some organizations are wildly successful with scrum, while others are 100%
mediocre.
</p>

<p>
Once you understand the value-add of both systems, you can begin to pick apart
how users interact with both methodologies, why the methodologies fail in some
instances, and why they succeed in others. Quick aside: Part of it is because
GTD targets the individual, while Scrum targets the organization. And comparing
the two reveals the values and weaknesses of each, particularly of Scrum (I'm
not gonna delve too much into the dynamics here- but organizational level
solutions almost always fail if the individual isn't properly taken into
account, which is why Scrum is more prone to weakness and failure than GTD when
implemented).
</p>

<p>
So my epiphany is actually pretty simple- <i>project management is probably a
fractal pattern.</i> It applies to the individual, the organization, and beyond.
</p>

<p>
While simple, there are some interesting conclusions on what this means for
overall strategy.
</p>

<p>
What this means is that at an ideal level, the individual is doing something
like org-mode + GTD, the product-development department is doing something like
project documentation + scrum, and the business is doing it's analogue as a
whole (ie. the CEO + board of directors are managing their work as ideally as
possible).
</p>

<p>
The major point is that the strategies <i>align</i> at every level of analysis. From
the individual, to the sub-department in the business, to the entire
organization. The individual GTD-strategy can't be compromised for the
organization. But the organization can't be compromised for the individual. All
strategies have to be in harmony or it fails.
</p>

<p>
The key takeaway is that scrum (or any organizational project management tool)
<i>must</i> allow for the individual to make arbitrary decisions. They <i>must</i> give
the individual discretion. They <i>must</i> allow the developer to execute on the
tasks that they think is the highest value.
</p>

<p>
And to do this properly, it means that scrum estimates <b>don't matter.</b> If it
means the developer doesn't complete their assigned stories <i>at all</i>, then <i>so
be it</i>.
</p>

<p>
If you keep the weaknesses of scrum in mind, you can leverage estimates + user
feedback to be able to make future projections that are at least semi-realistic
so that business decisions get made. As long as all parties understand the
volatility inherent in the estimates (because we <i>don't</i> know what the reality
is of the market place, competitors, etc.; so the volatility in our product
development and business strategy can sometimes serve as the chaotic counterpart
to the marketplace's chaos).
</p>

<p>
Of course, it's reasonable for stakeholders to know what was done <i>instead of</i>
the assigned stories. If developers went off-the-road and worked on non-story
tasks, it should result in exponential returns, since they are deliberately
choosing <i>not</i> to pursue make-work tasks and instead are completing tasks that
give them a sense of doing something <i>useful</i>.
</p>

<p>
Forecasting and estimates <i>can</i> play a role in giving semi-realistic basis for
making decisions in other parts of the organization, so long as it's not more
time-consuming than it needs to be and so long as all parties understand the
volatility inherent in the forecast.
</p>

<p>
Scrum isn't bad, but it seems to propagate mediocre dynamics <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/cubicle-inventor-propst-hated-creation-2014-10">just like the
cubicle did.</a> Instead of being leveraged for it's strengths, and instead of
culling out it's weaknesses, scrum is often used to impose predictability on an
inherently unpredictable process. The results speak for themselves.
</p>

<p>
A good organization with quality project management is good <i>in spite of</i> scrum.
Because they'd be good anyway without it. The product leader "knows" GTD even if
he doesn't know <i>of</i> GTD. AKA the same attitude and values that would drive him
to adopt GTD if he knew of it, at least drive him to cull out make-work and to
focus on high-priority tasks. He has the same values and therefore would
<i>inevitably</i> implement a successful strategy, or <i>find</i> one that aligns with his
values. Those same values would lead him to interfacing with the higher and
lower levels of the organization with an acute awareness of the limits
forecasting. And they'd pick and choose the <i>useful</i> components of scrum
relative to their needs and cull the waste.
</p>

<p>
Turns out I don't hate scrum and project management.
</p>

<p>
I just hate when it's done in a nonharmonious fashion.
</p>

<p>
When it kills the individual or stalls the organization. The individual one is
worse in the short-term because it means the individual worker's day-to-day life
sucks and is closer to a prison. The organizational one is worse in the
long-term (and more catastrophic because of the network effect in the
meta-organization and the individuals it affects) because it means the
organization will probably die. It ain't effectively getting ahead of the 2
snakes.
