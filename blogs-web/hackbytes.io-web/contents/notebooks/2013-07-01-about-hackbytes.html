hackBytes is written for anyone who wants to master programming, as well as
computer science. The current focus for all content is mobile and web
application development.

<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org469f73c">
<p>
hackBytes is, at it's core, a set of notebooks. It contains a distilled,
to-the-point version of all the notes I have taken and the lessons I have
learned as a growing mobile and web application developer. The one caveat is
that I am intentionally making sure that the entire website can be understood by
anyone. That way, hackBytes can be used and understood by anyone seeking to
learn and improve their programming skills.
</p>

<p>
If there are ever any prerequisites to being able to understand something, I
will either:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>teach them myself</li>
<li>point to the most efficient way of learning the material</li>
</ul>

<p>
I do not intend to treat hackBytes as if it were a blog. Technology evolves and
concepts change all the time. As a result, I may decide to update old articles
with new information. If it helps, try not to think of hackBytes content as blog
posts, but rather a constantly evolving (and very informal) documentation.
</p>

<p>
In the future, I am going to tackle the computer science field. I eventually
want to understand advanced Machine Learning and Data Mining concepts. But one
thing at a time. These fields are extensive. For now, I am focusing exclusively
on mobile and web application development.

A new document is published sporadically! When I can maintain a regular schedule
for writing new content, I'll update this page with that schedule.

If you want to master programming as well as computer science, hackBytes may
serve as a potential resource. Especially if you are interested in mobile and
web application development.
</p>

<p>
hackBytes will contain thorough guides for each of the following fields:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Mobile Application Development</li>
<li>Web Application Development</li>
</ul>

<p>
Fields to be targeted in the future include:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Mac Software Development</li>
<li>Windows Software Development</li>
<li>Kernel Development</li>
<li>Computer Science</li>
</ul>

<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgf1b9fd4">
<p>
There are several approaches in terms of how you can effectively use hackBytes.
Though nothing is stopping you from using a different approach:
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Start from the beginning and work your way up.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Most time consuming.</li>
<li>If you're brand new to development you can gain the most out of this.</li>
</ul></li>

<li>Use whatever is relevant to your situation.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>This is effective when you <b>know</b> what you are looking for. You focus on
what you have not yet learned as opposed to spending time on material you
have already learned or on things you will not need to know.</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>

<p>
In short, while I AM writing everything so that it can be followed from
beginning to end, it is not necessary to do so.
