Here is a quick software development methodology cheat sheet.
</p>

<p>
<b>Note:</b> There are many specific processes defined for some of the methodologies
that are beyond the scope of this article. The main goal of this article is to
give very high-level definitions of each methodology.
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li><b>Waterfall</b> - You do ALL of one phase, then ALL of the next, then ALL the
next (eg. design -&gt; coding -&gt; testing).</li>

<li><b>Agile</b> - Agile is a philosophy, not a step-by-step methodology<sup><a id="fnr.1" class="footref" href="#fn.1">1</a></sup>. It is
a set of attitudes about software development with the goal of improving
communication and the overall development process for all parties involved.
You are "agile" if you align yourself with <a href="http://agilemanifesto.org/">the agile philosophy</a> and make
your actions in development reflective of that.</li>

<li><b>Scrum</b> - A template of steps to follow for the development cycle. It is an
implementation of agile- it is supposed to follow the principles and
attitudes of the agile philosophy. At the same time, it actually gives you
the steps that you can follow. In this methodology, you have a prioritized
todo list, and you incrementally and iteratively complete chunks of the todo
list. By performing incremental and iterative development, you allow
requirements to be flexible and changeable since you are not committing to
completing one entire phase before moving to another one (waterfall). Thus,
the development process can better cope with inevitable changes.</li>

<li><b>Extreme Programming (XP)</b> - XP is a methodology which implements <a href="http://www.extremeprogramming.org/rules.html">a set of
rules</a> that you follow to optimize software development and make it easier to
collaborate and work with a team while sustaining a high level of software
quality. XP is an agile methodology as it aligns with agile principles.</li>

<li><b>Kanban</b> - A software development process that aims to manage the flow of
items being worked on (for example, the flow of completion of each item on
the project's todo list). Kanban processes seek to identify and eliminate
bottlenecks in the software development lifecycle.</li>

<li><b>Lean</b> - Product development principles that have been translated to the
software development domain from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lean_manufacturing">lean manufacturing</a>. There are 7 principles-
eliminate waste, build in quality, create knowledge, defer commitment,
deliver quickly, respect people, and optimize the whole.</li>

<li><b>Cowboy Coding</b> - Developers have complete control of software development.
There is no formal structure that guides the project along. The easiest way
to think of this is as a "free for all" where you can do whatever part of
the project you want whenever you want.</li>

<li><b>Iterative Development</b> - The software is built knowing that future versions
(iterations) will be used to refine the project.</li>

<li><b>Incremental Development</b> - A software project is divided into chunks and
each chunk is developed by the team, one at a time.</li>

<li><b>No Silver Bullet</b> - A paper written in 1986 by Fred Brooks, in which he
argues that /"there is no single development, in either technology or
management technique, which by itself promises even one order of magnitude
improvement in productivity, in reliability, in simplicity."/</li>
</ul>

In the real world, a lot of people mix up agile and scrum. Sometimes
they mix up agile and some other completely unrelated methodology. Just remember
that agile is the philosophy, scrum is a methodology, and people will probably
get them mixed up.</p></div></div>
