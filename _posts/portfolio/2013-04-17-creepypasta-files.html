      <h2 class="screenshot-heading">Over 100 stories <span class="muted">to read.</span></h2>
      <p class="lead">There are hundreds of creepypasta available all over the web. We've compiled some of the most popular stories and packaged them in a free application for your mobile device or tablet.</p>
      <h3>Keep track with bookmarks</h3>
      <p>It can be difficult to navigate through hundreds of stories. Bookmarks give you a way to save references to your favorite stories, or to a story you want to continue reading some other time.</p>
      <p>You can add or remove bookmarks whenever you are reading a story by pressing the bookmark button on the top-right corner of the screen.</p>
      <h3>Portrait and Landscape support</h3>
      <p>This application supports all device orientations. Through the use of autoresizing masks, UI elements remain proportional and the user-experience is not compromised.</p>

      <p class="lead">Access the settings screen whenever you want. Just press the settings button on the top right corner. Other settings are automatically configured and tailored for the device in use.</p>
      <h3>Text-size</h3>
      <p>If, for whatever reason, you want to change the text size, you can do so in the settings screen. Simply click the text size button, and select a size.</p>
      <h3>Images</h3>
      <p>Whenever possible and relevant, an image may be displayed along with the story. There aren't many, but these images provide a much stronger vibe and realism to each story.</p>
      <h3>Phone and Tablet support</h3>
      <p>Whether you are using a mobile device or a tablet, this application has got you covered. Text and images will be rendered in appropriate sizes for each device. Tablet screens allow for slightly bigger text and larger images. Phones will render images to fit on the screen, relative to the screen-width.</p>

      <p class="lead">The code source is open and free to anyone. With it, you can create your own library application and customize it however you want.</p>
      <h3>The Source</h3>
      <p>Due to the nature of creepypasta being a free-story format (copypasta), it only makes sense to do our fair share and contribute in some way. Thus, the entire codebase is going to be open source and freely accessible by anyone. The code will be available on Github by June, 2013. Links will be available here.</p>
      <h3>Licensing Information</h3>
      <p>For legal purposes, we must supply a license granting rights for anyone to use the code however they want. Otherwise, the default case without supplying a license would be "all rights reserved," meaning it wouldn't be open source. Thus, to distribute this codebase, we are going to choose an open license that gives you the right to use the code for your own projects, modify it, make profit, etc. Details will be available once the source code is released.</p>
