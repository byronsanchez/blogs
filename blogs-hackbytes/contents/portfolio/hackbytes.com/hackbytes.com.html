<h2>Project Details</h2>

<p>
	hackBytes.com is a site cataloging experiences with developing
	in various languages. The main objective is to publicize and
	archive information that may be useful and applicable to other
	developers.
</p>

<p>
	This site was mainly created for the purposes of cataloging
	anything useful I learn. When I was younger, I honestly thought
	development would be an impossible skill to learn. There ended
	up being "key lessons" that I ultimately figured out. I will
	never forget them. But honestly, it wouldn't have hurt to learn
	them sooner. Maybe this blog will help others in figuring things
	out!
</p>

<p>
	hackBytes.com has been replaced by the new <a href="/hackbytes.io/">hackbytes.io</a> blog. You can still view the
	old hackbytes.com version on the <a href="https://demo.hackbytes.com">demo site</a>.
</p>

<h2>Simple design, focusing on what's important.</h2>

<p>
	The simple color palette places focus on and emphasizes the
	main content.
</p>

<h3>References</h3>

<p>
	hackBytes.com is completely driven on the purpose of being a
	useful reference to developers. Thus, a simple design
	naturally places focus on the content. Unnecessary
	distractions are completely avoided.
</p>

<h3>Simple navigation</h3>

<p>
	The hierarchy of the site's pages is kept relatively simple.
	There is the blog, which contains every post and each post's
	associated comments. There are also a few pages containing
	different bits of information about the site. Simple
	navigation means readers spend less time trying to find
	content and more time <b>getting stuff done.</b>
</p>

<h2>Built with powerful systems.</h2>

<p>
	This entire website is built on top of and makes use of some of
	the most powerful systems available in web application
	development.
</p>

<h3>Statically-generated</h3>

<p>
	Almost every part of the site is statically generated. This
	means that most of what a user sees are previously generated
	html files (thanks to <a
		href="https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll"><b>Jekyll</b></a>).
	This is a perfect system for a simple blog and portfolio,
	where dynamic programs typically cause much more overhead
	than it's worth.
</p>


<p>
	The portions of the site that make use of dynamic content
	generation use JavaScript to PHP as the client to server
	languages. Once the server has generated tailored content, it
	passes the generated data back to the JavaScript file as a JSON
	object. From there, the data is presented to the user.
</p>

<h3>Powered by Bootstrap</h3>

<p>
	The website is built on top of Twitter's Bootstrap. The
	website is mobile-ready and works on a wide range of devices.
</p>
