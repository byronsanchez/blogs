<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org1927866">
<p>
Developing an entire application takes approximately 2-3 months of full time
work, if you are working on the entire project by yourself. This can easily
increase with the complexity of the application. As you will soon see, it takes
such a long time because there are many aspects to application development -
testing, design, and lots more. Writing code is only a portion of the entire
process.
</p>

<p>
The following is a quick overview of the entire mobile application development
process. While different projects will almost certainly have different
requirements and different workflow-bottlenecks, this document should give you a
very high-level understanding of what it takes to build a mobile application.

<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orga54bcc7">
<p>
The high-level overview of the app development process is pretty simple. It can
be broken down to six phases:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Phase 1 - Brainstorming</li>
<li>Phase 2 - Wireframing</li>
<li>Phase 3 - Design</li>
<li>Phase 4 - Development</li>
<li>Phase 5 - Testing</li>
<li>Phase 6 - Release</li>
</ul>

<p>
Ideally, there would be a team, and each member could focus on their
specialties. However, if you hope to master becoming a solo developer, you
should take each phase seriously.
</p>

<p>
In other words, do <i>not</i> neglect one area simply because you feel you may not be
good at it. There are plenty of resources that will teach you the fundamentals
of development, design, testing, iterative release cycle practices, etc. It will
be a lot of work, but it <i>is</i> possible.
</p>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org285773f" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org285773f"><a id="ID-043d3ccc-2e42-4961-af6e-07a794ce1b52"></a>Phase 1 - Brainstorming</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org285773f">
<p>
With the knowledge that building a fully functional application can take
anywhere between 2-3 months of full-time work (and longer if you are only
developing on a part-time basis), it very quickly becomes clear that app
development will be a huge undertaking and a big investment.
</p>

<p>
Therefore, it is crucial that you plan your project as thoroughly as possible.
As the project progresses, you will end up making changes, coming up with new
ideas and new solutions for different parts of the project. However, you need a
solid, well-built plan that will act as the foundation for the rest of your
project.
</p>

<p>
Brainstorming includes (and is not limited to) the following:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>All ideas you have of potential projects you may or may not pursue</li>
<li>Your goals and the reasons you are undertaking the project(s)</li>
<li>Market research of the projects you wish to pursue</li>
<li>Your application specifications - detailed criteria for the application you
intend to develop</li>
<li>Knowledge of the resources you will need to complete and deliver your
application</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org82c8f08" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org82c8f08"><a id="ID-90907f66-7592-4b6a-91e2-aed30f016c33"></a>Phase 2 - Wireframing</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org82c8f08">
<p>
Wireframing begins once you have a solid well thought-out foundation underlying
your project. Wireframing builds on all the work you have done during the
brainstorming phase. Wireframing helps you begin building something tangible.
</p>

<p>
Wireframing forces you to thoroughly think through the entire application flow
at a high level. If you wait too long and make wireframing decisions during
development, you may find yourself with a badly designed application. This is
because development focuses on the much lower-level aspects of the application,
the individual building blocks as opposed to the overall blueprint. These are
two very different perspectives and they each deserve individual thought and
consideration. The high-level (wireframing) focuses on the overall structure and
functionality of the application and the low-level (development) focuses on how
that structure and functionality is actually implemented- how it <i>works</i> at the
code level.
</p>

<p>
You can wireframe on paper or you can use software. In either case, what you
want to do is create a preliminary model of your entire application. From the
launch screen, to every other screen, you want to begin conceptualizing the
entire flow, structure and basic functionality of the application. You want to
build the skeleton of your project based on what individual components <i>do</i> more
than anything else. This is not the time for designing graphics. Focus on
functionality and keep it bare-bones simple with regards to presentation.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org23247db" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org23247db"><a id="ID-fc0f86eb-8eed-45f3-938f-b6b76aefecad"></a>Phase 3 - Design</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org23247db">
<p>
The design phase takes approximately the same amount of time as the development
phase. It <i>is</i> possible to handle development and design yourself. However, the
main issue with such an approach is efficiency. You can get a lot more done in a
lot less time with a well-organized and well-coordinated team than you can by
yourself. But in the case where this is not yet possible, it may be that you
have to take on the design role yourself.
</p>

<p>
Be aware that you should be putting as much effort into design as you are going
to put for development. This means learning a little bit about color theory,
typography, vector art, icon design and more if you do not have any previous
experience.
</p>

<p>
Design is important. No matter how well-written your code may be, your users may
never see it. Well-written code should never be noticed. Badly-written code
<i>will</i> be noticed, because the functionality of the application will be hindered
in some way (e.g., through lag, crashes, etc.). Design, however, is the phase
that allows you to present your application in any way you wish to the user. You
can make it look professional, competent and visually appealing, or you can make
it look the opposite.
</p>

<p>
To start off, learn the techniques you need for the project at hand. If you need
some image buttons, this is an opportunity to learn about iconography and all
the necessary skills successful icon and button design may require. Learn what
you need. Inevitably, you will end up learning skills that you will be able to
apply elsewhere in the future.

<h2 id="org6f41579"><a id="ID-35a91b46-fc61-4b98-896d-0016c320a507"></a>Phase 4 - Development</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org6f41579">
<p>
You have an idea, you have done your research, and you have thoroughly
wireframed your application! You have even completed most, if not all, of the
necessary image assets and other design resources. Now you can finally get to
the coding aspect of the project.
</p>

<p>
This will take some time and a lot of problem solving. You will handle the
platform-specific APIs to interact with the mobile operating system and make
your application do exactly what you want it to do.
</p>

<p>
There's not much else to say. You code, you run the application, you debug and
then you code some more. It will be a slow process. Some days, you may only
successfully implement one feature. Sometimes, it may even take days of
full-time work to implement one feature. This is one of the critical places the
brainstorming phase will help you- you will have defined a set of application
specs required for the first release cycle. So while feature creep<sup><a id="fnr.1" class="footref" href="#fn.1">1</a></sup> may be
tempting, your set of requirements will trump anything else, keep you on task,
and keep you on schedule. If you find yourself spending too much time on
components not part of the original set of specs, it may be wise to cut that
component out entirely.
</p>

<p>
Manage your expectations and focus on your core requirements. More often than
not, those few core features alone will take a long time to properly implement
on various platforms as well as (depending on the platform) numerous devices.
You can always expand in future release cycles.

<h2 id="orgc2e9286"><a id="ID-0bb61a30-68b7-49ca-ac2e-81184dcb9560"></a>Phase 5 - Testing</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgc2e9286">
<p>
The testing phase is the phase in which you rigorously put your application
through as much trouble as possible. The goal is to build a high enough
confidence that your application will work under any number of conditions and
under any sort of treatment. The testing phase is the phase that your
application is being prepared for the production environment. You are preparing
to publicize.
</p>

<p>
You need to test on as many devices as you can get a hold of. If you have access
to physical devices, use them. Emulators and simulators are also available for
the different platforms. You can use them to run the applications on your
computer. However, testing on physical devices is always the best option. You
will not know how various parts of your application are functioning in a real
world setting unless you get it running on a physical device.
</p>

<p>
Always run your tests on both the oldest device you wish to support as well as
the newest device you wish to support. Test on the different screen sizes you
wish to support. Test on tablets as well as phones if you are providing support
for both. The end result should be that you are testing on a sample of devices
that is representative of the total number of devices you wish to support. You
may not be able to test on all of them, and in some cases, testing on every
device will prove to be impossible (e.g., Android runs on <i>thousands</i> of
different devices). Build a manageable sample of devices you can test on, use
emulators and simulators, and make sure to test on physical devices.
</p>

<p>
You may also consider performing alpha and beta testing. These are actually a
critical part of application development as well as software development in
general and there are many different ways to approach and execute these kinds of
tests. This should come after your individual sample-testing. The goal is to try
and put your application in real-world conditions using a much larger sample
size than you can provide on your own.
</p>

<p>
Testing is a major phase of software development. But it ensures that your
application is or will become reliable, robust and functional for all users.

<h2 id="org083cc04"><a id="ID-fe55b0fc-4ee0-4e7a-957b-c8a4fb49f597"></a>Phase 6 - Release</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org083cc04">
<p>
The release phase is more of a pseudo-phase. While it may not take as long to
complete as any of the other five phases, it will not exactly be a
one-click-submit-and-you-are-done kind of deal. There are several things you
need to prepare for and several things you need to do for the release phase.
</p>

<p>
In some ways, release is a lot like building a website landing page for a
product- you're going to need to show off your product, consider the best SEO
and keywords to use, write an attractive description and more. All of these will
be used by the various app stores when you create your application listing. This
is a major part of the marketing involved so that potential users will <i>want</i> to
download your application.
</p>

<p>
There are also technical requirements that you will have to complete, such as
signing your application using a digital signature to tie the application to
your identity. This signature would be used to allow future updates from only
that signature.
</p>

<p>
The different app stores give you all kinds of tools for monitoring your
application as well as various metrics- crash logs, download rates, retention
rates and more. Monitor and use this information for future release cycles.

<p>
Application development takes time. As you progress, you will learn and become
more and more efficient. Soon enough, you will have completed your entire
project. Like with anything else, all you have to do is keep at it.

<b>Feature creep</b> - Over a long time period, extra unnecessary features
seem to "creep" into the codebase. These features usually go beyond the
application's goals. This is often seen as negative because it typically
introduces more complexity to the code while providing little to no value. At
its worst, it can severely delay project completion and has been known to kill
entire projects.</p></div></div>
