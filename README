        hackbytes.com v0.1 <http://hackbytes.com>

This is the master repository of the http://hackbytes.com website. The
submodule repositories can be found at the following locations:

  http://github.com/byronsanchez/hackbytes.com-resources
  http://github.com/byronsanchez/hackbytes.com-dependencies

INSTRUCTIONS

  Clone the hackbytes.com repository, or alternatively, clone your fork
  of the hackbytes.com repository. Then add the necessary submodules:

    cd hackbytes.com
    git submodule add https://github.com/byronsanchez/hackbytes.com-dependencies.git vendor
    git submodule add https://github.com/byronsanchez/hackbytes.com-resources.git resources
    git commit -m 'first commit with submodules'

  Afterwards, you can install the packaged gems. The following install
  the gems to your system:

    bundle install

  If you want to install the packaged gems in the vendor directory, as
  opposed to having them installed directly on your system, run:

    bundle install --deployment

  Note that this command will enable a persistent switch that makes
  bundler look for the installed gems in the vendor directory. See the
  bundler documentation for more information:

    http://gembundler.com/

  The deploy.rb script has not been checked into the repository. It is
  simply an rsync command which uploads the _site/ directory to my
  server. Feel free to write a script tailored to your workflow.

  Now you're all set and can use hackBytes as a baseline to building
  your own custom Jekyll website!

STRUCTURE

  The repository tree structure.

    /           - contains the entire hackbytes.com website.

    _includes/  - contains common HTML files used in multiple webpages.
                  These are typically short snippets, like common
                  headers or footers.

    _layouts/   - contains the major theme templates.

    _plugins/   - contains plugins that extend and customize Jekyll
                  functionality.

    _site/      - The fully "compiled" website after Jekyll filters
                  every file through the different converters and
                  generators. This directory contains what website
                  users see.

    _posts/     - contains the website posts and other content.

    assets/     - contains files that extend website functionality.
                  These files don't go in the _plugins/ directory
                  because these files are not used by Jekyll. The
                  functionality is invoked in other ways (e.g.,
                  server-side syntax highlighting). This directory also
                  contains the website's Sass files.

    css/        - contains the sites stylesheets. These are generated
                  by Sass.

    js/         - contains the sites JavaScript files. Some of the
                  files are minimized by the Closure Compiler, and
                  some serve as CDN fallbacks.

    resources/  - contains the hackbytes.com-resources submodule. This
                  submodule contains image and media assets used on the
                  website

    vendor/     - contains the hackbytes.com-dependencies submodule.
