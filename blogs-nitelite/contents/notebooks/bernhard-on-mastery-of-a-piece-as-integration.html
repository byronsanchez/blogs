For me the ultimate test of technique is easiness. When something becomes easy,
then the technique to accomplish it has been mastered.

<p>
I think he was saying this in mechanical vs. fluidity.
</p>

<p>
Mechanical school of thought is to hyperfocus on convoluted fingering technique
that is not memorable to the unconscious.
</p>

<p>
Sort of like forcing yourself to walk unnaturally.
</p>

<p>
It never becomes easy because it never integrates. You're not taking the path of
least resistance, you're intentionally increasing resistance in your technique.
</p>

<p>
Bernhard, I think, was saying that practicing via these overly-mechanical
schools means you never master the piece.
</p>

<p>
Pianists like Chopin and Liszt ended up culling out the hyperfocused mechanics
and as a result could play pieces with unconventional technique (at-the-time)
and learn them in such a way that they could recall them after years of not
playing them.
</p>

<p>
Overly mechanical techniques will be forgotten until you relearn to play the
convoluted way.
