<p>
It's like an intersection of curation at different levels of analysis.
</p>

<p>
You curate the repertoire.
</p>

<p>
You pick the piece.
</p>

<p>
Then you listen to various implementations of that piece played.
</p>

<p>
Then you learn from the one you like the most as base.
</p>

<p>
Then you introduce and experiment with elements of other pieces you liked.
</p>

<p>
Then you experiment with your own ideas, from dynamics, to tempo, to anything
else.
</p>

<p>
As you grow, you'll develop styles that you like, a language of your own, and
the pieces that you play will be more original and honest to your
interpretation.
</p>

<p>
That is how you are creative as a musician.
