That way, I don't have to manually deploy.

As soon as I push to maybe github, the build kicks off and if the static assets
compile, they get sent off to S3.

It looks like there might be a bug that causes docker builds to override the
symlinks?

Explore why the symlinks are getting deleted and replaced with actual copies of
the global templates directory. It might be a Dropbox thing, it might be a build
thing (bind mounts?). See if you can produce the override and fix the issue.

Set up docker-compose so that it's much more trivial to orchestrate building,
running, deployment of all blog instances.

Ensure that the rem measurement is being used in stylesheets as opposed to px or ems (unless absolutely necessary).

Legacy IE does not support this, so a polyfill will be necessary.

Two enhancements can be performed on the codebase in terms of improving function definitions:

1. Ensure modularity in each definition.
2. Give each function a very descriptive name so that anyone who reads the code can instantly know what the function does without having to mentally decode the algorithms.

Expected Behavior: When a comment is submitted, the form should not prepend the protocol portion of the url (i.e. http) if one is already provided by the commenter.

Observed Behavior: When comments are submitted, the form processor is prepending http to addresses that contain https.

Steps for reproduction:

1 - Go to a page containing a comment form.
2 - Submit a comment, while setting the website url field to a url containing the https protocol.
3 - The output stored in the database will contain http://https://[url]

The current implementation uses a boolean to determine environments and how the build process will occur. A possible enhancement may be to use built-in features such as the local server shipped with jekyll. In addition to using the preview server, the project can also use build targets; one for development builds and one for production builds.

The current style of pulling the comments db, editing the values and pushing it up to production could be improved.

One idea is to create a small API to wrap simple db ops. Then, use a client script to invoke these ops. The result is that there is never a risk of causing collisions (during the pull and edit, the prod db is still capturing comments while you are editing your db; then when you push it back up, those comments have not been merged to the db you are pushing back up).

Thus, the API could be used to perform simple db ops. You can still pull the db, but you can't push. That way, you can also generate comments as necessary.

It usually requires 2 clicks of the preview button to get it to actually preview since the first click does nothing. Analyzing the NET requests on firefox reveals that POSTs are getting sent out on that first click even though it appears nothing is happening.

Investigate more and fix.

It's pretty volatile. Image size changes in the same carousel have unpredictable effects, perhaps due to the manual jquery centering I implemented.

Fix those issues, perhaps replace the carousel lib since this one isn't maintained anymore it seems.

Bootstrap 3 implementation will require a careful migration. Bootstrap 3 is mobile first and based on flat-design concepts.

Prior to migration, make sure the final design is complete and the mockups are readily available so it can be used as a reference.

Legacy IE support will also require a lot of rework.

Currently, during builds for both development and production environments, server-side dependencies are downloaded and installed as part of the build process in order to ensure that native extensions are built for the architecture on the target system.

Gems are checked into the repo, so it makes more sense to simply use them and simply rebuild the native extensions whenever a build occurs.

The command to invoke is as follows:

    bundle exec gem pristine --all

Basically, it seems like URI structure is a lot like taxonomy for org-mode.

SEO and linking conventions make it so that the URL should be the authoritative unchanging ID. But the way taxonomy works properly is bottom-up development, which inherently implies change.

Eg. Over time, portfolio contents accumulate and blog contents accumulate and you see a need for a reclassification with distinct portfolio and blog buckets. So the URI structure changes.

And on and on.

Perhaps the best approach is to keep it as simple as possible. Always stick to a static flat URI structure: domain.name/document-name

No attempt at taxonomy since taxonomy implies change. Collisions are simply handled by appending a number to the document.

The only reason I used the YYYY-MM-dd structure was because I picked up the habit when using vim files for a wiki + Jekyll conventions.

I needed a way to encode the date data of file creation in the path name, because it's a pseudo unique id that prevents collisions.

Is that necessary anymore? Can I remove that portion?

Given that /good/ taxonomy is always a WIP that depends on a currently available dataset, and that taxonomy should change as data accumulates, as well as my own personal preferences, I've decided to go with a flat URI structure with no ids.

I want the URIs to be easily readable and typable.

I liked the YYYY-MM-dd structure because I used it for old journals a lot. But then I played around with a flat structure and liked that as well. So it must be the familiarity which is why I can go either way.

The flat structure seems the most appropriate and in line with my goals for the blog, so I'll go with that.

Though, I am very happy I was able to implement ids for [1a9f7b133d]. Those aren't meant to be human-readable links, but machine-readable persistent links, so it all works out.

This is now fixed.

I think this was one of the hopes for the migration from markdown to org-mode, ie. one of the original motivations, that perhaps org-mode handles footnotes with some more thought to edge cases.

Fortunately, this was indeed the case. The html exported footnotes are relative to the *relative* path of the headline's document.

In other words, if we have a headline with the following structure:

```
,* This is a headline

This is a footnote in the headline[fn:1]
```

Then the exported footnote link will look something like this:

/this-is-a-foot-note-in-the-headline#fn.1

In other words, index pages won't have collision issues between documents with footnotes even if they both use the same footnote naming convention (fn:1, fn:2, etc.) because the exported links will always take you to the target document's permalink which isolates the footnote scope to that document!

For those reasons, I am marking this as fixed.

Mostly to follow standard practices and to learn how to use the technologies involved with proper CI.

CI is good practice for ensuring integration of code does not cause build failures, test failures, etc. And should these errors and failures occur, devs can know quickly and fix them.

This will be done once 15-20 articles have been posted. Do a secondary testing across all targeted browsers and make sure everything works as specified by the specs.

this is for path.php. currently, the 301 redirect makes it so that the stage website redirects to the production site. this isn't really a problem, but see if a 301 redirect without the domain name portion is possible.

Mainly because it seems I'm moving everythign to org files, at least for some
projects (blogs). Like docs, and tasks are best managed by org-mode for my blog
projects.

Perhaps the same will be true for music production and other software projects I
have.

[2018-03-19 Mon 00:53]

Decided to live in the project systems (fossil, ticketing, etc.) since it's more
potential to open for collabs and scaling.

I will "check out" tasks and stuff into org-mode, but the authoritative source
will be in the project repo- fossil, git issue tracker, whatever it is.

Maybe I'll adopt the same policy for Salesforce...

I don't own the data with that, so I'm more hesitant, but I'll think about it.
Maybe if I get comfortable with managing exported data.

# hackBytes Analysis

## Description

hackBytes is the brand that represents Byron Sanchez. A lot more can be
done by branding the name hackBytes, as opposed to branding a normal
name like "Byron Sanchez."

One area of consideration is freelancing. Should the freelancing brand
be seperate, or should it be hackBytes? This decision is not important now, but it is necessary to be aware of.
For now, we must assume that hackBytes could very well evolve into a
freelance business and treat it as such. This is the most best way
to approach the project while maintaining all options for the future.

So for now, let's assume that hackBytes its both my brand as a
developer, should I ever wish to get hired by a company or should I ever
wish to take on clients.

One final area of consideration is hackBytes videos. While it is
tempting to pursue the creation of tutorial series in video format, it
would be best to use video as a content channel only when it is truly
the best medium to communicate the content (for example, if I must
display a lot of visuals and screenshots would actually be much less
helpful). hackBytes is not going to be a tutorial site teaching
programmers how to develop from the ground up. It will contain guides
and documents, but not entire courses. So if we want videos, make them
relevant and make sure they are the best channel for communication.

In short, the brand is Byron Sanchez, the developer. I want to market myself
as a well-versed mobile and web application developer capable of guiding others
to becoming professionals within these fields.

## Google Analysis

### Findings

**Search Term: Byron Sanchez**
**Platform: Tor**

Facebook = 2
Anomaly Radio = 5
Github = 6
hackBytes = 8
twitter = 9

Page 3 = Internet Archive Creator Page
Page 4 = StackOverflow, lastfm generic artist page

## hackBytes Account Username List

Note: It may make sense to use "byronsanchez" whenever possible, as this
might get linked. Usually, these links point to the site's profile page
which may get indexed on Google. Do this if you WANT the results
to show up in Google.

If a target site has multiple accounts, one is meant for the professional hackbytes page
while the other is meant for the "casual" personal page.

### TODO: Process

- Remove Anomaly Radio from front page
- Move hackBytes to first result
- StackOverflow to front page
- Linked-in to front page
- Use hootsuite, buffer and tweetdeck for building presences on various
  social media sites.
- Find relevant, interesting forums, create accounts and participate
- Aim for once a month videos to post on the hackBytes website
- Post regular content. Ideally 3x a week, but aim for at least 1x a week for now
- Commit daily (or at least make an effort to. The effort will translate to some
  kind of regularity)
- Tone it down, just like Darwin did with his profile. Time to go professional
- Determine if Chompix should be front-paged.

- Hootsuite
- Buzzbundle
- Buffer
- Tweetdeck

Goals:

  - Build a large readership
  - Sell freelance services for mobile and web apps/sites

Notes:

  - The two goals cater to two different audiences, though  there may be overlap.
    However, the readership will probably not be the paying customer (for
    freelance services). Thus, here we may have two distinct market segments.

# notes

some notes regarding the comments system

## current workflow

the comment database on the production server acts as a net. it captures
comments that can be moderated.

I'm working on making the workflow a lot simpler, but for now I'm keeping these
notes so I know where I left off in the design of the comments system.

### net management

net management is currently done as follows.

- comments db is on server and captures comments
- author pulls a copy of the comments db
- author moderates comments
- author pushes updated db to server
- the local copy of the db can be used to generate static html pages containing
  the comments

this is a direct, two-way dev machine to prod machine connection. stage isn't
used for this.

tldr;

  1. pull db from prod
  2. moderate db
  3. push db to prod
  4. use local copy to gen the static pages

### comment publishing

  this is step 4 above

  the db copy is read by a script and yaml files are generated
  during the jekyll build process, the yaml files are read and the content of
  the comments are placed in the appropriate page

# tehpotatoking.com Specifications

Description of how the app works.

## Overview

tehpotatoking.com is my personal blog. It is intended to be a place where I can
post
about anything I want, without any filter. The main purpose of the website is
to keep track of the different projects and goals I am pursuing, to log my
experiences as well as what I learn, and to drive me into accomplishing
whatever I set out to do. Ultimately, I want to accomplish as many of my goals
as I can - these range from building all kinds of different software to
learning many different skills and even travelling to lots of different places.

Disclaimer - This spec is a work in progress! Software is constantly changing
and this spec will undergo future revisions to keep up with changing
requirements. If there is anything wrong with this spec, let me know and I will
review it. The graphics here are not representative of the final product.  They
are simply used to help communicate the underlying functionality of the app. The
purpose of this spec is to described what the user will see as they interact
with the application. Lastly, the details concerning algorithms to be
implemented are not covered in great depth within this spec. If explanations and
further documentation are necessary, they will be located in another document.

## Scenarios

Some sample scenarios of how the stereotypical user may use the app.

**Scenario 1: Tom the Reader**

Tom is a software engineer working in Buffalo, New York. He doesn't follow many
blogs. A few have caught his eye and fewer have kept his interest.
tehpotatoking.com has fortunately made it on his list of must-follows. He can
sometimes relate to
the author. The author often makes a fool of himself when trying to accomplish a
particular task or goal, especially when it is something he has never done
before, but there is often some good experience gained. Tom values this and does
the same. To Tom, it is refreshing to know others are willing to take risks and
look like a fool, because Tom does this as well. And sometimes, when you are
trying to do something that may be considered intimidating or risky, its great
to know you're not the only one.

**Scenario 2: Jenna the Reader**

Jenna is a one of a large community of bloggers interested in getting the most
out of life and finding adventures wherever possible and most importantly,
accomplishing the goals each person has set for themselves. She keeps
up-to-date with other bloggers by following their writings and they stay in
touch with her, typically through her blog. One of the blogs she follows is
tehpotatoking.com. By reading the writings that focus on finding adventure and
accomplising goals, Jenna is surrounding herself with attitudes that encourage
her and support her own drive in doing the same.

**Scenario 3: Byron the Publisher**

Byron (me!) is a developer who loves building things. Most importantly, he loves
learning things and having awesome experiences with great people. To keep track
of the different projects he is working on, to keep track of the goals he is
pursuing, and to make sure there is some pressure of accountability so he
actually completes at least *some* of the things he wants to do, Byron starts a
blog. He publishes to the blog regularly. He talks about everything he is
learning as well as the progress he is making with his goals.

He maintains the entire website, mostly through the command line. He uses
content management commands to create posts and pages. He uses comment
management commands to moderate and approve comments. Finally, he uses website
commands to generate the static website, along with any submitted comments, and
deploy the website to production. The entire process allows him to quickly
generate a website and deploy it without the need for memory-consuming processes
in production (the website is static, so the bare-minimum is needed in
production to serve pages to readers!).

## Non-Goals

This version will *not* support the following features:

  - An easily customized replicable website from which other custom websites can
    easily be derived.
    - This requires complete abstraction of tehpotatoking.com custom information
      which
      is currently not on the agenda. A future release may allow for this, but
      it is not the focus of the current release.

## tehpotatoking.com

The guts of the spec are located below. For now, here's a quick flow chart to
get started. It's not 100% complete, but it'll give you the overall idea for the
"storyboard" of how the website will be used, from the perspective of the
reader.

![](img/app-flow.png)

The publisher command line interface can be divided into three general
subsystems:

  1. The Content Management System - Creating posts and pages
  2. The Comment Management System - Moderating user comments
  3. The Build System - Generating the static files and deploying the website to a
     server

![](img/cli-flow.png)

## Screen by Screen Specification

tehpotatoking.com is made of several different pages. Almost every page will
have the
same design and have similar functionality. Design will be implemented
separately, so the images used here are not representative of the final product.
This doc is focused on functionality and interaction desig, not the exact look
and feel of the website.

### Main Template

Almost all pages will have the same layout and structure. Unless otherwise
noted, all pages discussed in this spec contain the following structure:

![](img/screen-template.png)

The masthead will contain the website name and a short description. The navbar
will be the main navigation tool used for major parts of the website. Social
links will provide readers with different ways to connect. The sidebar is
intended to be flexible and will contain blocks of content. Things like an
"About Me" area, "Recent Posts", or "External Links" are a few possibilities for
sidebar content blocks.

The content area is a critical component of the template. It is where
page-specific content will be displayed. The actual content is dependent on the
URL of the page. The archives link will be displayed only on the index page,
below the content area. The footer contains any site-wide data and links, such
as copyright messages, developer and design information, and a back-to-top link.

### Index

When the user first visits the website, they will be immediately taken to the
index page. This page is located at the root of the website. It displays the
five most recent posts. The layout for each post in the content area looks like
this:

![](img/content-index.png)

The format is similar to that of a journal entry:

  - The date is at the top right corner
  - The title is aligned to the left and underlined
  - Optional data tags are located to the right of the title. These are not
    underlined, and these are smaller than the title text
  - Optional "legend" for possible color codes and formatting used within the
    entry
  - Optional "rating" on a scale of 1-5; used for rating the personal
    significance of the content within an entry
  - Optional image(s)
  - Optional embedded audio
  - Optional embedded video
  - Optional YouTube video
  - The main post content with optional headers for defining subsections

The index provides a "Read Post" link that takes a reader to the post page for
that entry. Below the "Read Post" link is author and comment information.

### Posts

Post pages are dedicated to displaying a single post. The content structure for
a page dedicated to displaying a single post is as follows:

![](img/content-post.png)

Posts pages contain almost the exact same structure as that of the index. The
differences include:

  - Comment information is moved to the comment section
  - Five related post links are displayed below the author information
  - Pagination links are displayed if there are previous or next posts in the
    timeline of all posts. The most recent post will not have a next link and the
    oldest post will not have a previous link. If there is only one post, then no
    pagination links will be displayed.

### Comments

Comments are displayed below posts, on pages where a single post is the main
content:

![](img/content-comments.png)

The total comment count is shown at the top. Below that is a thin border.

Comments are displayed in chronological order. Each comment will have an
associated user metadata. This includes:

  - An avatar
  - Username
  - Date and time the comment was posted
  - A Permalink so individual comments can be linked to

> **Design Note**
>
> Each odd comment will have the user image and comment metadata on the left
> side. Each even comment will have the user image and comment metadata on the
> right side. Comments will have a dialogue-bubble design.

### Comment Form

> **Technical Note**
>
> The comment form will use JavaScript front-end validation as well as backend
> PHP validation. JavaScript will need to be enabled if a user wishes to
> submit a comment.

The comment form is displayed in post pages, below the comments section. It
takes on the following structure:

![](img/content-comment-form.png)

The comment textarea is the only required field. The name, email and web url
fields are optional. If a name is not provided, the user will be considered an
anonymous commenter. Below the comment input field are instructions explaining
how the comment system works. The post button will submit the comment for
moderation. The preview button will create a sample of what the comment will
look like when it is published.

### Pages

The content structure for a standard page is as follows:

![](img/content-page.png)

The structure of a page can be thought of as a stripped down version of a post.
There is no date information nor is there any author information. Comments are
not displayed at all. Pages are intended to be standalone pieces of content.

### Contact Form

The contact form's structure is a lot like that of the comment form, with a few
subtle differences. The contact form's structure is as follows:

![](img/content-contact-form.png)

Instructions for contacting me are below the page heading. The message, name and
email fields are required. The web url field is optional. The contact form does
not have a preview button. Instead, the message can only be submitted.

### Archives

The archives will list all available posts on the website in reverse
chronological order.  The structure is as follows:

![](img/content-archives.png)

The archive will contain the entire list of all published posts. There will be a
heading for each month, along with the year. Below the heading will be that
month's list of links.

### RSS Feed

The RSS Feed will not use the same template as other pages. It will be a valid
RSS file that readers can subscribe to. The link will be internal, using the
tehpotatoking.com domain. The feed should allow readers to read the last ten posts of
the website. More is acceptable, in fact the more the better. But no less than
ten if there are ten or more posts available.

## CLI Specification

tehpotatoking.com management is done via the command line. This functionality consists
of various commands that execute different administrative tasks.

### Content Management

The following commands should be available for managing the website's content:

  - draft[title] - Creates a new draft. Drafts are not compiled into generated
    websites.
  - post[title] - Creates a new post. Posts will be compiled into generated
    websites.
  - publish[title] - Publishes a draft by moving it from the draft directory to
    the post directory. This makes it so that the content is compiled into
    generated websites. Title is optional. If no title is specified, list all
    files in the drafts directory.
  - page[title] - Creates a new page, to be compiled into generated websites.

### Comment Management

The following commands should be available for managing reader submitted
comments:

  - comments-pull - pulls the comment database from the server
  - comments-push - pushes the local comment database to the server
  - comments-generate - generates markdown files from the local comment
    database. These files are then used during website compilation. Only
    published comments are generated into markdown files
  - comments-list - list all comments in the database
  - comments-review[id] - view a specified comment
  - comments-delete[id] - delete a comment from the local database
  - comments-publish[id] - publish a specified comment
  - comments-unpublish[id] - unpublish a specified comment
  - comments-merge - fix a server-local database merge conflict. This is used in
    the case that the server database received new comments while a local
    comment database was being modified. The comment subsystem will try to merge
    these databases. However, if there are merge conflicts, these conflicts will
    need to be manually fixed. Once these conflicts are fixed, this command must
    be run to complete the entire process. If the server is repeatedly getting
    new comments while a local database is being modified, then it is a sign
    that a new solution is necessary

### Website Management

The following commands should be available for managing the website's overall
build and deployment process:

  - init - Sets up the project so that it is immediately usable after a fresh
    clone. This command will ensure any dependencies are downloaded and all
    initial commands and configurations are executed and set
  - build - Runs the site compilation steps and generates the static website.
  - test - Runs all available tests
  - build-tests - Compiles all available tests that needs compilation or any
    other kind of setup
  - run-tests - Runs tests without building them. This command assumes that any
    tests that needed building have already been built
  - clean - Deletes generated and compiled directories
  - env[id] - The id is optional. Without the id, the command will output the
    current environment being used. Passing an id sets the environment to the
    one associated with that id. In our case, 0 = development and 1 =
    production
  - deploy - Deploys the website to a server. The server can be staging or a
    production server

  wintersmith decision

  restore backup of blogs, revert wintersmith to non-edited checkpoint, and just
  leverage import paths for coffee and sass files, and see if you can do the same
  with templates (eg. layout: ../blogs-universal/src/contents/templates) etc.

  manage it like that.

  to really go in deep with wintersmith, I have to learn the entire architecture.
  everything is tied together:

  - async ops
  - relative and full file paths relative to contents directory
  - plugin loading, template loading, content output files, etc.

  and im not sure that's a wise move given alternative solutions like react based
  ones, and even perhaps just moving to straight org mode with reference
  templating as front end assets, but moving compile-time steps to org-mode.

  basically, it's not a quick hack fix, it's a small architecture rewrite to get
  wintersmith to do what i want to do.

  So I'd rather just work with it as it exists now, and evaluate alternative
  solutions if it becomes to much of a bottleneck, and only then decide on
  wintersmith small rewrite, vs. org-mode migration vs. alternative static site
  generator that does what I need it to if it exists. (and if it doesn't, I'll
  have to weigh the options of cost of migration + cost of rewrite and whether
  it'll be trivial or non-trivial, etc. I think org-mode migration is the most
  viable long-term solution however, since other than jekyll, most generators seem
  to come and go).

The key requirement is to essentially remove all grunt build tasks such that the
entire website can be built from running a single command:

    wintersmith build

The following explains why the Dockerfile uses both `--prefix` and `NODE_PATH`.

The prefix argument *must* be supplied within docker containers if you want
packages to be installed in non-standard directories.

If you are in a root project directory and run `npm install`, it'll install it
in that project directory, duh! So you have to provide an `npm --prefix
/path/to/dir install` argument if you want the packages to be installed
elsewhere.

`$NODE_PATH` does nothing in terms of deciding *where* to install packages. All
it does is tell node additional directoies to look in order to resolve
`require`'s in js code.

- tpk is a personal blog
- the main thread is the story of the author trying to achieve an around the
  world adventure
- focused on having adventures
- focused on personal growth
- focused on learning
- once the adventure can be achieved, focused on the travel aspect
- the entire format is supposed to be like a public journal, filtered for only
  stuff people might be interested in.
- This can be considered "tpk's workbook"
  - it can have project progress pages, project lists, etc.
- In fact its probably best to think of this as a workbook for tracking
  projects
- Design should be dark-ish.
- a simple blog. Nothing has to be too over the top and all out. Just a nice
  design that can be oriented to adventure and travel
- adventure oriented.
- lots of photos

- context analysis

  There are currently many travel blogs, some with huge followings, some with
  little. There are many more personal blogs out there and it is very tough to
  build a readership, especially in blogging. The more popular blogs tend to
  regularly offer something of value to the reader. Whether it is
  self-improvement tips, awesome photos or videos, or advice of any kind.

  Most shared posts are short, simple and easy to relate to. By short, this
  means not hard to read. A wall of text is very intimidating. The longer the
  text, the more an investment reading is.

  Most readers use mobile devices, such as cell phones and tablets. The days of
  everyone using desktops is long over. My readership will be mostly people
  using mobile and tablet devices. Especially, since most are probably out and
  about and doing some kind of "reporting back" as they stretch from their own
  comfort zones to go on their own adventures.

  The readership will probably not be on the site all day. Chances are, there
  will be more checking in than hours of devotion to the single site. Much like
  DV DJs. Those who check in may be loyal, but depending on my own habits and
  the content, it may be few.

  The best way to build a readership is to become part of the communities I am
  interested in - self improvement as well as travel. Those are clearly the two
  main points I am currently interested in. Make it adventure, make the content
  itself an adventure, as if they are on it with me, and make it something they
  may be able to do as well. Have a site that is very simple to check in as
  opposed to a site that one must commit themselves to. No forums are
  necessary.

- target audience?

  - age range - mid-to-late twenties - my age when I begin to travel so
    probably around 27-30
  - Geographic location - America, probably metropolitan areas
  - Interests - travel, adventure, self-improvement, learning
  - Needs - They want to improve who they are as people. They want to live more
    fulfilling lives, which implies they are willing (or at least considering)
    making changes to the way they live. They love adventures and want to be
    exposed to the idea of traveling. They love learning, growing and doing
    awesome things.

- message to communicate?

  - "lets go on an adventure >:)"
    - The attitude that smile conveys to me is important. Though be careful on
      coming across as a complete dumbass or douchebag.
    - Important because there are lots of pressures, both self-imposed and
      externally imposed, to do certain things, live certain ways, follow
      patterns, styles, etc. The smile is "fuck you. fuck them. lets have fun
      and do awesome things."
    - a personal feel definitely. it should be relatable, so they can easily
      think of themselves pursuing their dreams unapologetically.

- technical requirements

  - The end result will consist of a package of files that can be used on a
    Wintersmith website. It will contain png, psd, jade, css, javascript and
    other needed files that comprise a complet web site template.
  - The website will use a fluid grid system to implement responsive design.
  - The fluid grid will use the following sizes at least:
    - 1200, 900, 768, 480
    - If time allows, more can be implemented.
  - Complete freedom in design, no constraints except those imposed on the
    wireframes. If necessary, these constraints can be removed by the designer.
  - A logo or a picture to associate with tpk, something brandable that
    represents a symbol for the identity

Comparing other projects

  webapplog

    - the position of the navbar
      - The social links in the navbar on the top right
    - The overall simple layout
    - the clear uncluterred sidebar

  hackBytes

    - The overall structure of the blog. Simple and easy to navigate

  Dream Views

    - The colorscheme - a dark navy with a hint of leaning towards the purple
    - The fonts of the djs - Georgia with serifs and the color coding
    - The journal entry heading styles
    - There version is neutralish, but I'd like more saturation on the color
      scheme

  Gaia Online

    - Love the alternating position of the comment bubble design.
    - worried that it might throw off the overall design
    - alignment of chat bubbles or like GO where they just pass the metadata
      box

  Deviant Art Comments

    - Love the comment bubble design
    - usernames and metdata at the top

  Mr. and Mrs. Adventure

    - The way the left sidebar gives a dedicated feel, sort of like a remote
      control to the page
      - It also appears to have a very slight opacity which gives it a slight
        glassy feel
    - The main post boxes have the same slight opacity as the sidebar
    - This implies a bg that can be seen through the slight opacity

  ItsAlyx.com

    - LOVE the "scrapbook"/workbook feel
      - Definitely want tpk to be the "scrapbook" of my life

  IntrepidXJ

    - Love the Journal style they use
    - X Trip YYYY | Day n
    - Tuesday, February 14th, 2013

    - Potential ideas:
      - Every post can be "categorized" under a project
      - the project has a name and day/task or some enumerable component

  Fearful Adventurer

    - The Instragrammy-ish photo cover for each entry is cool.
      - It matches the layout and seems perfectly fitted to it.
    - Don't like the top brittle design
    - love the way the main content area and the wide sidebar complement each
      other
    - The greys seem to work well in emphasizing the photos often used
    - Generous use of design - love this; feel free to create and use design tpk
      content. its great practice and can communicate more than words
    - love the font of the main site title
    - like how she has a huge splash portion for images
    - then she has categories
    - then she has the recent posts
    - This is the first magazine-ish structure I've seen that I actually like
    - For blog posts she doesn't use a big splash image but a normal image that
      aligns with the width of the text
    - love the image collages, makes it feel like a true scrapbook

  Conclusion/Requirements

    DISCLAIMER - This is the conclusion of what the customer MAY be going for.
    It is up to the designer to truly explore all possibilities to tell a story
    or communicate the appropriate message the client wishes to. To do this,
    the designer must not yet constrain themself to what the client has said.

    - Looks like the overall architecture of the site is to go for a
      magazine-ish scrapbook. AKA a showy, image-oriented scrapbook, with
      subtleties of the scrapbook portion and more of the magazine-ish portion.
    - The structure/layout should ultimately conform to a standard blog design,
      but there will be new elements added on top of this to give it more of
      the feel of a well organized magazine.
    - The design will contain subtleties that are reminiscent of a scrapbook.
      (fronts, the way images may be collaged/laid out together, etc)
    - The bubble comments is optional, only if it fits the design

  I would get a conceptual agreement based on my understanding of the
  requirements, and have them entertain the willingness to consider a proposal.
  The CA is an oral agreement that the objectives, mos and val to organization
  is accurate. This is key so that they understand the value of your service
  and there is demand for you.

PROPOSAL

  If there were to be a proposal to this project, it would conform to my
  general freelance proposal methodology. I would truly understand the scope of
  the project and have a good estimate as the time it would take based on the
  requirements I have gathered from client interviews. I would build these
  requirements and present them to the client in the proposal.

  Most freelance graphic design should fit nicely with the freelance
  methodology.
